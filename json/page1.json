	"Section": "<section><h1>A Standard for the Transmission of IP Datagrams on Avian Carriers</h1><h2>Status of this Memo</h2><p>This memo describes an experimental method for the encapsulation of IP datagrams in avian carriers.  This specification is primarily useful in Metropolitan Area Networks. This is an experimental, notrecommended standard.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.</p><h2>Overview and Rational</h2><p>Avian carriers can provide high delay, low throughput, and low altitude service.  The connection topology is limited to a single point-to-point path for each carrier, used with standard carriers,but many carriers can be used without significant interference with each other, outside of early spring. This is because of the 3D ether space available to the carriers, in contrast to the 1D ether used byIEEE802.3.  The carriers have an intrinsic collision avoidance system, which increases availability. Unlike some network technologies, such as packet radio, communication is not limited to line-of-sight distance. Connection oriented service is available insome cities, usually based upon a central hub topology.</p><h2>Frame Format</h2><p>The IP datagram is printed, on a small scroll of paper, inhexadecimal, with each octet separated by whitestuff and blackstuff.The scroll of paper is wrapped around one leg of the avian carrier.A band of duct tape is used to secure the datagram's edges.  Thebandwidth is limited to the leg length.  The MTU is variable, andparadoxically, generally increases with increased carrier age.  Atypical MTU is 256 milligrams.  Some datagram padding may be needed.</p><p>Upon receipt, the duct tape is removed and the paper copy of thedatagram is optically scanned into a electronically transmittableform.</p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Multiple types of service can be provided with a prioritized peckingorder.  An additional property is built-in worm detection anderadication.  Because IP only guarantees best effort delivery, lossof a carrier can be tolerated.

While broadcasting is not specified, storms can causedata loss.  There is persistent delivery retry, until the carrierdrops.  Audit trails are automatically generated, and can often befound on logs and cable trays.</p><h2>Security Considerations</h2><p>Security is not generally a problem in normal operation, but specialmeasures must be taken (such as data encryption) when avian carriersare used in a tactical environment.</p><h2>Author's Address</h2><p>David WaitzmanBBN Systems and Technologies CorporationBBN Labs Division10 Moulton StreetPhone: (617) 873-4323EMail: dwaitzman@BBN.COM</p><article>Waitzman   Page 2</article></section>",
